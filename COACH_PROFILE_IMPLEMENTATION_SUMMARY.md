# Coach Profile Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete coach profile management system that allows coaches to set up and manage their professional information without impacting existing functionality.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (039_coach_profile_management.sql)
- **Idempotent migration** - Safe to run multiple times
- Added indexes for efficient coach queries:
  - `idx_profiles_role_active` - For finding active coaches
  - `idx_profiles_tenant_role` - For tenant-specific coach queries
  - `idx_profiles_settings_specialties` - For specialty-based filtering
  - `idx_profiles_settings_meeting_types` - For meeting type filtering
- Created database functions:
  - `validate_coach_settings()` - Ensures coach settings JSON structure is valid
  - `get_available_coaches()` - Returns coaches with their settings for a tenant
  - `update_coach_profile()` - Secure function for coaches to update their own profiles
- Added constraint to validate coach settings structure

### 2. API Route (/api/coaches/profile/route.ts)
- **GET** endpoint - Fetches current coach profile settings
- **PUT** endpoint - Updates coach profile settings
- Validates coach permissions (coach, manager, tenant_admin roles)
- Validates specialty and meeting type selections
- Uses database function for secure updates
- Follows existing API patterns and error handling

### 3. Coach Profile Page (/dashboard/coach/profile/page.tsx)
- Comprehensive form for managing coach professional information:
  - **Specialties**: Multi-select from predefined coaching areas
  - **Meeting Types**: Preferred meeting formats (video, phone, zoom, etc.)
  - **Professional Bio**: Description of coaching background and approach
  - **Credentials**: Certifications and qualifications
  - **Availability Notes**: Scheduling preferences
- Real-time validation and character limits
- Responsive design following existing UI patterns
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Permission-based access control

### 4. Navigation Integration (dashboard/layout.tsx)
- Added "Coaching" section to sidebar for users with coach permissions
- "Coach Profile" menu item with proper active state highlighting
- Only visible to users with coach, manager, or tenant_admin roles
- Fixed accessibility linter errors (added missing button titles)
