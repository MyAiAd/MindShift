- **Full-text search indexes** using PostgreSQL GIN
- **Efficient pagination** with offset/limit

### **Data Integrity**
- **Foreign key constraints** with proper cascade behaviors
- **Unique constraints** prevent duplicate likes, tag names per tenant
- **Check constraints** for status enums and data validation
- **Atomic operations** for complex multi-table updates
- **Trigger-based consistency** for denormalized counts

### **Extensibility**
- **JSONB metadata fields** for future feature additions
- **Enum status types** easily extensible
- **Modular API design** following REST conventions
