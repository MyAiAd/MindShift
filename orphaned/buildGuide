now that the site is fully multi-tenant i want to cover a core tenet

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENT: Automation-First Architecture

### Core Principle: 95% Automation, 5% AI

**The treatment flow MUST be implemented as a finite state machine with predetermined scripts, NOT as AI conversations.**

### Implementation Approach:

**1. State Machine Controller (Primary Logic)**
```javascript
// This handles ALL treatment flow - NO AI involved
class TreatmentStateMachine {
  phases: {
    intro: IntroPhase,
    discovery: DiscoveryPhase,
    problemShifting: ProblemShiftingPhase,
    diggingDeeper: DiggingDeeperPhase,
    integration: IntegrationPhase
  }
  
  // Every response goes through automated validation FIRST
  processUserInput(phase, step, userInput) {
    const result = this.validateAndProcess(phase, step, userInput);
    
    if (result.canContinue) {
      return this.getNextScriptedResponse(result.nextStep);
    } else {
      return this.triggerAIAssistance(result.reason, userInput);
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Scripted Response System (Instant Performance)**
```javascript
// Pre-defined responses for instant delivery
const SCRIPTED_RESPONSES = {
  problemShifting: {
    step1: "Please close your eyes and keep them closed throughout...",
    step2: (problemStatement) => `Feel the problem '${problemStatement}'... what does it feel like?`,
    step3: (lastResponse) => `Feel '${lastResponse}'... what happens in yourself when you feel '${lastResponse}'?`
    // ... exact scripts from documents
  }
};
```

**3. AI Assistance (Only When Triggered)**
```javascript
// AI called ONLY for specific scenarios
const AI_TRIGGERS = {
  userStuck: (response) => response.length < 3 || response === "I don't know",
  needsClarification: (response, step) => !validateExpectedResponse(response, step),
  multipleProblems: (response) => countProblems(response) > 1,
  tooLong: (response) => response.split(' ').length > 20
};

// Minimal AI usage with strict context
async function getAIAssistance(trigger, userInput, currentStep) {
  const prompt = `You are assisting with Mind Shifting treatment at ${currentStep}.
                  User said: "${userInput}"
                  Issue: ${trigger}
                  Provide brief clarification to help them understand, then return to exact script.
                  DO NOT deviate from treatment protocol.`;
  
  // Short, focused AI response only
  return await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "system", content: prompt }],
    max_tokens: 100 // Keep AI responses minimal
  });
}
```

### Performance Requirements:

**Response Times:**
- **Scripted responses: <200ms** (instant)
- **AI-assisted responses: <3 seconds** (only when necessary)
- **Overall session: 90%+ instant responses**

**Cost Control:**
- **Target: <10% of interactions use AI**
- **Average tokens per AI call: <200**
- **Session cost target: <$0.05 per 30-minute session**

### Development Priorities:

1. **Build the finite state machine FIRST** - Complete treatment flow with zero AI



### Quality Assurance:

**Testing Requirements:**
- Verify every treatment path works without AI
- Confirm AI triggers only activate in specific scenarios
- Validate response times meet performance targets





**Success Metrics:**
- 95%+ responses delivered via automation
- <5% sessions require AI assistance
- Sub-second response times for scripted content
- Zero deviation from Mind Shifting protocols

This architecture ensures our treatment methods remain pure and effective while providing the speed and reliability needed for success.

ignore this next part for now:
2. **Add voice interface** - Web Speech API integration
3. **Add AI assistance layer** - Only for specific trigger scenarios
4. **Implement usage tracking** - Monitor AI usage vs scripted responses
5. **Optimize performance** - Ensure sub-second response times
- Test voice interface accuracy across devices
